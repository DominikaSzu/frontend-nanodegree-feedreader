# FEED READER

## Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Feed Reader Testing Project

### Code Dependencies

This application is built using Google Fonts and Jasmine (Behavior Driven Development testing framework). The HTML, CSS and JS script were provided by the Udacity.

### What is it?

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

### How it works?



19. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
 
21. Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage),  provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.
