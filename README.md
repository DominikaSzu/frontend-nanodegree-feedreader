# FEED READER

## Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Feed Reader Testing Project

### Code Dependencies

This application is built using Google Fonts and Jasmine (Behavior Driven Development testing framework). The HTML, CSS and JS script were provided by the Udacity.

### What is it?

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It gives the user a possibility to display and reed different articles from:

* the Udacity blog
* the CSS-Tricks 
* the Web Fundamentals page
* the Linear Digressions profile on SoundCloud

### How it works?

The application loads feeds using the Google Feed Reader API. Function loadFeed() will display feed entries on the page.

There is also a hidden menu, with four categories of feeds loaded from the Google Feed Reader API.

### How to run it?

To run the application, the user has to open index.html file in his browser (for example by clicking on it with right mouse click and choosing the option like "open with Google Chrom/Internet Explorer" ecc.). 

Once the application is opened, the User has an access to all the articles and can see their titles. From that point, he can go directly to the article he's interested in, or click on menu icon and choose the category which interests him the most.
